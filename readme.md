GlueDB is a database abstraction layer for PHP.

Goals :

- automatic type casting of strings coming from the database to the appropriate PHP types and more complex formatting operations such as serialization/unserialization,
- unified database introspection API,
- framework for setting up application wide aliasing of database tables and columns identifiers,
- query builder with support for nested boolean and join expressions,
- PDO centric, in a way that fully exposes its interface,
- true, not PHP emulated, prepared statements,
- support for MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite out of the box, with possible extension to other RDBMS.

Under development.
