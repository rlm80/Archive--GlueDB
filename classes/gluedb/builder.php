/**
 * Base builder class.
 *
 * A builder is an object that provides a fluent interface to build an expression. An expression is
 * represented internally as an array of components. Components will be run one by one through the
 * compiler and concatenated to produce the resulting SQL expression.

/*
 Note :
 	Using a "nested" fluent API (builders that may return children builders, not always $this) seems the most natural
 	way to go about this, since boolean and joins expressions are nested in nature. But as tempting as it may be, it is
 	NOT the right way to go about this. It is too confusing when the query has to be built in several steps, instead of
 	just one long "sentence" :

		// suppose addthis() returns a child builder :
 		$query1->addthis()->addthat();

		// You might think this is the same as the above :
		$query2->addthis();
		$query2->addthat(); // But it does NOT work !

		// It shoud be :
		$childbuilder = $query2->addthis();
		$childbuilder->addthat();

	Just too confusing...and that's only the tip of the pile of problems that arise from it when things get more complex.
