/**
 * Base fragment class.
 *
 * A fragment is a data structure that describes a piece of SQL query and generates
 * the corresponding SQL string.
 *
 * Fragments are arranged as a tree, each fragment belonging to a parent fragment. At the top of
 * this tree is the query. Each fragment in the tree compiles into a string that is the SQL
 * representation of that fragment and the whole subtree that lives under it.
 *
 * Fragments cache their compiled SQL representations. When a change occurs to a fragment, these
 * caches are invalidated from child to parent all the way up to the root of the tree.
